## Files Included

- `Quantium Data Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing full code for data cleaning, merging, and visualization.

---

## Project Overview

The analysis focuses on:
- Exploring transaction and customer data
- Identifying purchasing behavior and patterns
- Understanding the effect of loyalty status on buying habits
- Visualizing the insights with graphs

---

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Regular Expressions (re module)

---

##  Key Tasks

- Imported and cleaned transaction and customer data
- Merged datasets using unique identifiers
- Created visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Used regex and custom logic to extract numeric values from product names

---

##  Insights Generated

- Loyalty customers showed consistent purchase behavior
- Seasonal or popular product categories were identified
- Transaction trends provided insights into sales volume and product movement
- Frequency distribution revealed customer engagement levels

---

##  Sample Visuals

Bar plots, countplots, and distribution graphs were generated to summarize:
- Customer loyalty distribution
- Most frequently purchased products
- Purchase volume comparisons

---
